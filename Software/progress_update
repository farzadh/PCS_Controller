The latest version of Arduino FW, it is able to read HV voltage correctly and report 299.6V.
The main source of issue at the moment seems to be LV voltage, for which error 67-DCDC-LV-Rationality is continuously reported. 
- update: after fixing LV voltage to 14.5 volts, error 67 is resolved
- update: CAN rationality error for message 819 was resolved by increasing length to 5


Observations:
- It is advised to first enable PCS ('e') and then enable DCDC ('f') within a short time span.
- There are several errors that show up, but consistent error at the moment is 67-DCDC-LV-Rationality

Strange observation:
- Original Damien's code uses DCDC and CHARGE enable lines as active-low. However, as soon as I enable PCS, w/o enabling DC/CHG functions, I get following errors: DCDCEnableLineMismatch, CHGENABLELINEMISMATCH. By making them active HIGH, this error goes away!!!!
   --> update: I was wrong, these lines are actually active-high, hence it's all good now.

AI:
- In progress: Use SavvyCan together with Can DBC database for Tesla Model 3 to decode all messages on IPC CAN and possibly figure out what's wrong with PCS
- Currently, we are receiving two error messages: 24VCFrontMia, and 107-Unknown. For error 24, we can try testing with a better 12V battery and see if that goes away.
   --> another option is to try playing with VCFront message, and see if changing values of some parameters make a difference.
   --> Also you can take a look at some CAN logs that Damien has in his repo, and see if you can find VCFront messages in them

- Find a DBC file that decodes error 0x424. That message provide specific details about what's going on with each error code, including error 0x24
