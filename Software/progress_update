The latest version of Arduino FW, it is able to read HV voltage correctly and report 299.6V.
The main source of issue at the moment seems to be LV voltage, for which error 67-DCDC-LV-Rationality is continuously reported. 
- update: after fixing LV voltage to 14.5 volts, error 67 is resolved
- update: CAN rationality error for message 819 was resolved by increasing length to 5


Observations:
- It is advised to first enable PCS ('e') and then enable DCDC ('f') within a short time span.
- There are several errors that show up, but consistent error at the moment is 67-DCDC-LV-Rationality


AI:
- Use SavvyCan together with Can DBC database for Tesla Model 3 to decode all messages on IPC CAN and possibly figure out what's wrong with PCS
